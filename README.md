## Understanding Sports Betting Types on TMS

  

Since TMS covers multiple betting strategies, here's how they approach different types of sports bets:

  

### Primary Bet Types

  

**Moneyline Bets:**

TMS provides straight-up winner predictions without point spreads.

These work well for baseball and hockey where games often have clear favorites.

  

**Point Spread Bets:**

Their most common recommendation type.

TMS analyzes line movement and provides reasoning for taking favorites or underdogs against the spread.

  

**Over/Under Bets:**

Total scoring predictions with detailed statistical analysis.

They often identify weather factors or pace-of-play trends that affect scoring.

  

### Advanced Betting Strategies

  

**Parlay Combinations:**

TMS shows how to combine multiple bets for higher payouts.

They emphasize proper bankroll management since parlays are higher risk.

  

**Teaser Bets:**

Adjusted point spreads across multiple games.

TMS explains when teasers provide value vs. straight bets.

  

**Proposition Bets:**

Player-specific wagers like rushing yards or strikeouts.

Their Player Props tier focuses heavily on these markets.

  

### Specialized Markets

  

**Futures Bets:**

Season-long wagers like championship winners.

TMS typically recommends these early in seasons for maximum value.

  

**Live Betting:**

In-game wagering as events unfold.

They provide guidance on when to take advantage of shifting odds.

  

**Round Robin Bets:**

Multiple parlay combinations from a larger set of picks.

This reduces risk while maintaining upside potential.

  

## Pros and Cons
